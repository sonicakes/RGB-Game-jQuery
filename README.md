## The Project

This game tests a users' knowledge of colour codes and improves their colour selection skills. The game displays to the user a selection of randomly generated colour tiles, alongside a single colour code, and asks the user to select the correct tile. 

At first I coded the game in vanilla JS,  based on requirements from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course - https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/. Then, I re-made the game in jQuery.
